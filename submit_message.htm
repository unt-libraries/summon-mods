    <p><strong style="font-size: 16px;">Good deal.</strong> We'll take a look and contact the system vendor so that they can work
        with the responsible parties to get the issue fixed. In the meantime, you may be wondering ...
        <strong style="font-size: 16px;">What's up with the broken links?</strong></p>
    <p>When you submit a search to Find Articles, you're searching a gigantic index containing documents from over
        136,000 different journals and 7,250 publishers. But the system powering Find Articles <strong>doesn't actually
        host the published version of anything in its index</strong>. Even the <em>publishers</em> don't necessarily
        host the published version. When you click a link to access the full text, you're actually requesting access
        to a version that's hosted on a completely external system most likely owned by one of a few different content
        aggregators (like EBSCO, or ProQuest, or Gale). In order to get you the correct article, the system has to
        request it in <em>just the right way</em> using <em>just the right data</em>. Since there are no guarantees
        about data format, quality, or consistency from publisher to publisher and aggregator to aggregator, any data
        in the mix that doesn't quite match up can make the lookup request fail and block you from accessing
        your article.</p>
    <p style="font-size:14px;"><strong>The only way to fix these problems is to report them to the system vendor so that they can
        work with publishers and aggregators to fix the affected metadata. If we don't know about problems, we can't
        report them. So <span style="font-size:18px;">thank you</span> for telling us! The more reports you submit the better the
        system works for everyone.</strong></p>
