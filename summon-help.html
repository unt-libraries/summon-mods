        <h1>What is Find Articles? What is Summon?</h1>
        <p><strong>Find Articles</strong> is UNT Libraries' online service that allows you to search one place to find 
            full-text, online articles that appear in journals that we subscribes to. The system that powers this search
            is called <strong>Summon</strong>.</p>

        <h1>The link to the article I need is broken.</h1>
        <h3>Reporting Broken Links</h3>
        <p>We can report broken links to Serials Solutions for repair, but first we need you to report them to us. To 
            help make this easier, we've added a button to each article in your search results, labeled 
            &quot;<strong>Report Broken Link</strong>.&quot;</p>
        <p>To report a broken link, click the button for the affected article. A very brief form will pop up asking you 
            to tell us what appeared to be wrong. You also may optionally enter your email address and comments, if you 
            have them. After you submit the form, the system sends the metadata for that article along with your 
            comments to us, and we forward that information along to the vendor who manages the system.</p>
        <h3>Why Broken Links Happen</h3>
        <p>Summon's search index is huge&mdash;it contains documents from thousands of different journals and 
            publishers. But it doesn't actually host the published version of anything. In fact, where and how to get 
            the published version of a document varies from institution to institution depending on what journals and 
            database packages the institution subscribes to. So linking you to a copy of your article isn't a simple 
            matter of pointing to a single URL where that document resides&mdash;it's actually a complex negotiation 
            between the Summon service and any number of potential external systems. Often these external systems are 
            owned by one of a few different content aggregators&mdash;such as EBSCO, ProQuest, Gale, etc. On top of 
            this, not all content in Summon can be linked to directly&mdash;in some cases you get routed through UNT 
            Libraries' link resolver, which might send you to a copy of the journal instead of the exact article.</p>
        <p>When you click a full-text link, Summon first tries to determine where to get the document. If it can link 
            you directly to the article, it submits a request for it to the appropriate service. In order to get you 
            the correct article, the system has to request it in <em>just the right way</em> using <em>just the right 
                data</em>. Since there are no guarantees about data format, quality, or consistency from publisher to 
            publisher, aggregator to aggregator, and system to system, any data in the mix that doesn't quite match up 
            can make the lookup request fail and block you from accessing your article.</p>
        <h3>Other Ways to Get Your Article</h3>
        <p>If you find an article using Find Articles but can't get the full text through Summon, there's a good chance 
            that you can get it another way. Use the link labeled &quot;<strong>Check More Sources</strong>&quot; 
            (beside the Report Broken Link button) to get a short list of steps you can take to find it, tailored 
            specifically to that article.</p>

        <h1>I'm having some other technical issue.</h1>
        <p>If you are having technical issues getting Find Articles to work correctly <strong>other than broken 
            full-text article links</strong>, please submit a report to us via our 
            <a href="https://library.unt.edu/ask-us" target="_blank">Ask Us</a> service.</p>

        <h1>How can I tell what databases I'm searching?</h1>
        <p>Currently UNT Libraries has over 700 databases activated in Summon. Using Find Articles queries everything 
            that's in the Summon index that we subscribe to, limited (by default) to journal articles from 
            peer-reviewed sources.</p>
        <p>But the content in Summon's index doesn't come from databases, so you're not really searching databases when 
            you use Find Articles. Summon's content comes straight from journal publishers. As far as Summon is 
            concerned, databases only indicate where it might fetch an article's full-text&mdash;they do not serve as 
            the data source for the index. This is why you can't limit your Find Articles search to particular 
            databases.</p>

        <a name="search-query" id="search-query"></a>
        <h1>How do I build my search query?</h1>
        
        <h3>Phrase Searching</h3>
        
        <p>Summon allows for phrase searching with the use of &ldquo; &rdquo;. The query &ldquo;teacher education&rdquo; 
            will find results with that phrase.</p>
    
        <h3>Searching Specific Fields</h3>
        
        <p>The single search box in Summon (basic search box or keyword search box in advanced search) will search
            across many fields automatically. For example, entering an ISBN, ISSN, or Call Number will bring back 
            associated records.</p>
        
        <p>You can explicitly search a field using the syntax: &ldquo;field:(query).&rdquo; For example, the search 
            ISSN:(1234-5678), finds records that contain that value in the ISSN field.</p>
        
        <p>Searchable fields:
            <ul>
                <li>Title</li>
                <li>SubjectTerms</li>
                <li>Author</li>
                <li>Publisher</li>
                <li>PublicationTitle</li>
                <li>Volume</li>
                <li>Issue</li>
                <li>Language</li>
                <li>Notes</li>
                <li>ISBN</li>
                <li>ISSN</li>
                <li>DOI</li>
                <li>DEWEY</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    
        <h3>Boolean Operators</h3>
    
        <p>Summon offers the following Boolean operations: OR, NOT and AND. The operators must be written in 
            ALL CAPS.</p>
        
        <p>By default, all terms in a search are combined with the AND operator. To expand the results set, use the OR 
            operator &ldquo;microcircuits OR nanocircuits&rdquo; will return items that contain either term.</p>
    
        <p>This can be combined with quoted terms such as
            &ldquo;teacher education&rdquo; OR &ldquo;educator
            training&rdquo;.</p>
    
        <p>To exclude items in Summon, use the NOT operator
            or &ldquo;-&rdquo; character before a term. When
            used in the following query &ldquo;animal NOT
            dog&rdquo; the results will not include the term
            &ldquo;dog&rdquo;.</p>
    
        <h3>Wildcard Use in Summon</h3>
    
        <p>Searches within Summon can be performed using
            the wildcards &ldquo;?&rdquo; and
            &ldquo;*&rdquo;.</p>
    
        <p>The question mark (?) will match any one
            character and can be used to find
            &ldquo;Olsen&rdquo; or &ldquo;Olson&rdquo; by
            searching for &ldquo;Ols?n&rdquo;.</p>
    
        <p>The asterisk (*) will match zero or more
            characters within a word or at the end of a word. A
            search for &ldquo;Ch*ter&rdquo; would match
            &ldquo;Charter&rdquo;, &ldquo;Character&rdquo;, and
            &ldquo;Chapter&rdquo;. When used at the end of a
            word, such as &ldquo;Temp*&rdquo;, it will match
            all suffixes &ldquo;Temptation&rdquo;,
            &ldquo;Temple&rdquo; and
            &ldquo;Temporary&rdquo;.</p>
    
        <p>Wildcards cannot be used as the first character
            of a search.</p>
