        <h1>Everything behind a single searchbox.</h1>

        <p>Introducing the Summon service, the revolutionary new unified discovery service from Serials Solutions.
            The Summon unified discovery service allows the researcher to quickly search, discover and access reliable
            and credible library content. It goes beyond federated search, beyond next-generation catalogs to create an
            all-new service for libraries. Through one simple search, it provides instant access to the breadth of
            authoritative content that's the hallmark of great libraries - digital and print, audio and video, single
            articles to entire e-journals, and every format in between. No need to broadcast searches to other
            databases - it provides one search box for a researcher to enter any terms they want and quickly get
            credible results in one relevancy ranked-list.</p>
